# SkipsoLabs - Full Stack PHP Developer Test

# Installation

- Go to backend_json_server and run php -S localhost:8003 -t public/
- Go to the frontend and run "npm install" and after "npm run serve"
- Go to http://localhost:8080/ or http://localhost:8081/ to access the form submition page, and /list for the listing page


# Notes

- I've done a version of the backend using database persistence just for fun, the correct one is the backend_json_server
